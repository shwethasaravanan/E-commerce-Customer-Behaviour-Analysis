# E-commerce Optimization Through Data Insights

## Overview

This project aims to optimize an e-commerce platform by leveraging data insights to enhance customer satisfaction and revenue. The focus is on customer segmentation and membership optimization using R, statistical methods, K-Means clustering, and ANOVA.

## Skills Used

- R
- Statistical Methods
- K-Means Clustering
- ANOVA
- Regression Analysis

## Project Process

1.  **Data Cleaning:**
    -   Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
    -   Normalized numerical variables to ensure consistent scaling.
    -   Encoded categorical variables for effective analysis.

2.  **Customer Segmentation:**
    -   Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.
    -   Identified and analyzed patterns in low, moderate, and high spenders to understand their behaviors and preferences.
    -   Derived actionable insights from each customer segment.

3.  **Membership Analysis:**
    -   Performed ANOVA to examine the relationship between membership tiers and spending/satisfaction levels.
    -   Determined the impact of membership status on customer behavior.

4.  **Predictive Modeling:**
    -   Utilized regression models to identify factors influencing customer satisfaction, such as age and purchase frequency.
    -   Developed models to predict customer satisfaction based on various input variables.

## Reflection

This project significantly enhanced my skills in:

-   Statistical analysis and data modeling using R.
-   Customer segmentation techniques (K-Means clustering).
-   Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for group comparisons.
-   Regression analysis for predictive modeling.
-   Bridging the gap between technical data analysis and strategic business decision-making.
